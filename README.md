The goal of today's homework is to learn how to connect libraries to projects.

Attention! For this homework you will need data from the 1st year coursework.

Step 1

Connect the commons-lang3 library (using Maven) to your project from past homework (employee book).

Step 2

Implement verification of all text data incoming from the user (employee names and surnames) using the StringUtils class.

If the check fails, throw an exception returning a 400 Bad Request status.

Step 3

If the data has been verified, make sure that the employee's first and last name will be capitalized.
